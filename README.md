#### What's this?
A GPL WordPress theme for blogs, magazines and more. The theme is based on our wp_booster framework and uses tagDiv Composer for live frontend editing.

#### How to use it?
If you just want to use the stable version of the theme, please [download if from our main site](https://www.wpion.com/ionmag-theme/). The theme that is available here on github is the development version and we don't recommend that you use this on live servers.
